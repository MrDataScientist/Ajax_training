This is a simple distributed application that I built to learn more about Ethereum development tools and how they work together. The project was bootstrapped with [vtw](https://github.com/wilfreddenton/vue-truffle-webpack) a simple command line tool to generate a boilerplate distributed app.

**Disclaimer**: This is just a toy application I have built to learn more about developing distributed applications on the Ethereum Blockchain. Please do not use this to send real Ether. Perhaps in the future it will be more robust and available for production use.

## Install

1. `truffle compile`
2. `cd app`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`

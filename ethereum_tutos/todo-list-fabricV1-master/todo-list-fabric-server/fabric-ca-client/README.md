## Hyperledger Fabric Member Service Client for Node.js

This package encapsulates the APIs to interact with the Fabric member service to manage user certificates lifecycle such as register, enroll, renew and revoke. There is a separate package that interacts with Peers and Orderers of the Fabric network to deploy chaincodes, send transaction invocations and perform chaincode queries, and that is called `fabric-client`.

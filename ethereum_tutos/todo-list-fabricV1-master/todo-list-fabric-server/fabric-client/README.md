## Hyperledger Fabric Client for Node.js

This package encapsulates the APIs to interact with Peers and Orderers of the Fabric network to install and instantiate chaincodes, send transaction invocations and perform chaincode queries. There is a separate package that interacts with the Fabric member service to manage user certificates lifecycle such as register, enroll, renew and revoke, and that is called `fabric-ca-client`.

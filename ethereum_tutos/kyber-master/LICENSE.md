# Code Licenses

For all code in this repository, BigchainDB GmbH ("We") either:

1. owns the copyright, or
2. owns the right to sublicense it (because all external contributors must agree to a Contributor License Agreement).

Therefore We can choose how to license all the code in this repository. We can license it to Joe Xname under one license and Company Yname under a different license.

The two general options are:

1. You can get it under a commercial license for a fee. We can negotiate the terms of that license. It's not like we have some standard take-it-or-leave it commercial license. If you want to modify it and keep your modifications private, then that's certainly possible. Just ask.
2. You can get it under the AGPLv3 license for free. You don't even have to ask us. That's because all code in _this_ repository is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPLv3), the full text of which can be found at [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html).

If you don't like the AGPL license, then just ignore it. It doesn't affect any other license.

All short code snippets embedded in the official BigchainDB _documentation_ are also licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, the full text of which can be found at [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
